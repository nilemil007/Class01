<h1><u>My Future Plan of Life</u></h1>
<p><strong><u>Introduction:</u></strong> Everyone should have a specific future plan in their life. In my life, 
I have got a future plan or <strong><em><u>aim,</u></em></strong> and I am very honest about my aim. I know that without an <strong><em><u>aim,</u></em></strong>
 life is like a ship without n rudder, that doesn’t know his goal. <strong><u>But I know my goal and I am working on my goal.</u></strong><br><br>
<strong><u>My Future Plan of Life:</u></strong> I always wanted to be a doctor and now my family is inspiring to become a doctor. 
My parents are really supportive and they give importance to my opinion. Now I read in class nine and I will give an SSC examination next year.<br><br>

I am a student of the science group. Without studying science, someone can’t become a doctor. My favorite subject is Biology. 
My teachers are really helpful; they help me a lot to understand everything on this particular subject.<br><br>

<em>Mr. Fazlur Karim</em> is the biology teacher and he knows about my future plan. He always inspires me to work harder and pursue my aim in life. 
The reason behind <strong><em><u>My Future Plan</u></em></strong> I have a few specific reasons for my future plan. 
I was living in a village when I was 10 years old. I have seen that there is not a proper medication system for the villagers. 
Few village doctors are working, but they don’t have proper knowledge of medical science.<br><br>

I always wanted to do something for these people. After completing my medical degree, I will be there and start providing free treatment for poor peoples. 
My reason is too much honest; I want to serve the society for being better.<br><br>

<strong><u>My Preparation:</u></strong> As I said before, I am a high school student in class nine. 
After completing SSC I will admit myself in a local college to pursue an HSC degree. After completing HSC, I will participate in the medical admission test. 
I am pretty much confident about that and I know I will work hard to pursue my dream.<br><br>

<strong><u>Conclusion:</u></strong> Everyone should have a reasonable aim in their life that will help you to reach success.</p>
